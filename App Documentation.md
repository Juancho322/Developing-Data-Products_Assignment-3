## Sky Distribution of Galaxies in the Atlas3D Survey

• This data comes from the **Atlas3D survey** which included ~800 early and late type galaxies.

• In the plot, the distribution of the galaxiesvin the sky can be seen. Sky coordinates use right ascension and declination instead of longitude and latitude.

• Galaxies can be classified according to their appearance or by parameters such as the presence of a disk of stars, compactness of spiral arms, or smoothness of the light distribution. In the **Atlas3D** 
  survey, the galaxies were classified into ellipticals and spirals by visual inspection. The color of the markers in the plot shows the T-type, which is used to classify galaxies into elliptical (T <= -0.5,
  early-type) and spiral (T > -0.5, late-type).

• With the slider you can select which galaxies to plot according to heliocentric velocity relative to the **barycenter** of the Solar System. For example, to see the center of the **Virgo cluster** set the 
  minimum to -300 and the maximum to 200.

• Clicking on a marker shows the information for that galaxy below the plot. If the galaxy was observed by the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey**, the URL will take you to its Navigate section.
